IPMIwatch is a program to monitor IPMI-capable sensors and notify you in real-time should something exceed a specified threshold.
It has the ability to send alerts via the Discord Webhook API should you choose to select that option. I made the alerting mechanism
as modular as possible, so feel free to add a new alerting module if you're interested!

Usage:
    java -jar IPMIwatch.jar <options>

Examples:
    java -jar IPMIwatch.jar --temp 55 --fan 40
    java -jar IPMIwatch.jar --temp 60 --log /var/log/IPMIwatch-log.txt
    java -jar IPMIwatch.jar --fan 30 --alert https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/136156426833869378/VMfizhohu7t0UHkfcu9xUqPGJ8rMv8PAWD36HHfkBBFBOa6N9JQfWs8iSen4J33P01Wr

Options:
    -h, -H, --help      Displays this handy dandy help file!
    -v, -V, --version   Displays program version info
    -t, -T, --temp      Sets the threshold temperature (C) when action should be taken
    -f, -F, --fan       Sets the threshold fan speed (%) when action should be taken
    --log <path>        Logs events to a file with timestamps
    --alert <address>   Generates an alert should sensors exceed thresholds.
                        This can currently only be a Discord Webhook URL, but we may
                        also support email addresses here in the future. To use that,
                        enter the Webhook URL as the alert address
